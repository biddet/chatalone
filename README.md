This project was inspired by Deven Rathore's article: [Building a Real-Time Chat App with React and Firebase](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/)

Thanks to Deven for providing starter code and his wonderful explanation of Firebase auth & db.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
